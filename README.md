# Graphics Library Project

## Overview
This project involves developing a software system using a simple graphics library for rendering graphics and handling events on a Windows console. The implementation must be object-oriented, leveraging **association**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** to meet the requirements. Proper commenting, meaningful naming conventions, and a user-friendly interface are essential.

## Instructions to Run the Software
1. Download the provided source code from the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up for running the program:
   - **Operating System**: Windows
   - **Development Environment**: Any C++ IDE or compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, MinGW, etc.)
3. Open the project files in your preferred IDE.
4. Build and compile the project to generate the executable file.
5. Run the executable file to interact with the software.

## How to Use the Software
- The program provides a graphical interface for users to interact with.
- Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions for navigating through the system.
- Ensure to input valid data whenever required by the program.
- Use keyboard and/or mouse inputs (if supported) to interact with the graphics.

## Features
- Object-oriented implementation adhering to the principles of association, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Interactive graphics rendered on the Windows console.
- User-friendly interface to ensure smooth interaction.

## Important Notes
- **Code Quality**: The source code includes meaningful class and member names, as well as detailed comments for better readability.
- **Plagiarism**: This project must be an original work. Any instance of plagiarism will lead to:
  - An **F grade** in this course.
  - Referral to the **Disciplinary Committee** with the possibility of further penalties (up to 5 F's in all registered courses).

## Collaboration
- This project can be done in groups of up to two members. The following information must be included:
  - **Name and Roll Number** of all group members.
  - Ensure proper division of tasks and contribution by each member.

## Group Members
- **Member 1**: Name (Roll Number)
- **Member 2**: Name (Roll Number)

## Additional Requirements
1. Follow **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles.
2. Use descriptive and meaningful names for all classes, methods, and variables.
3. Comment the code properly to explain functionality and logic.
4. Make the software intuitive and easy to use for users.
